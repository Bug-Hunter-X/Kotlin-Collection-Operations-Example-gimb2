This repository contains a simple Kotlin program that demonstrates common operations on lists. The program showcases the use of the `map` function for transformations and the `add` and `remove` functions for modifying mutable lists. The program is designed to illustrate basic Kotlin collection handling, and it does not include any deliberate bugs. It is intended as a learning example for understanding common Kotlin list manipulation techniques.
